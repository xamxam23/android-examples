ModelMapper automatically determine how one object model maps to another, base on conventions, in
the same way that a human would, while proving a simple API for handling specific use cases.

ModelMapper analyzes your object model to intelligently determine how data should be mapped.
ModelMapper does most of the work, automatically projecting and flattening complex models.
